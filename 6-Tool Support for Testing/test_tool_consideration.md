# Test Tool Considerations 

Test tools can be used to support one or more testing activities. Such tools include: 

- Tools that are directly used in testing, such as test execution tools and test data preparation tools
- Tools that help to manage requirements, test cases, test procedures, automated test scripts, test
results, test data, and defects, and for reporting and monitoring test execution 
- Tools that are used for analysis and evaluation 
- Any tool that assists in testing (a spreadsheet is also a test tool in this meaning)



### Test Tool Classification

Test tools can have one or more of the following purposes depending on the context: 

- Improve the efficiency of test activities by automating repetitive tasks or tasks that require
significant resources when done manually (e.g., test execution, regression testing) 
- Improve the efficiency of test activities by supporting manual test activities throughout the test
process
- Improve the quality of test activities by allowing for more consistent testing and a higher level of
defect reproducibility 
- Automate activities that cannot be executed manually (e.g., large scale performance testing) 
- Increase reliability of testing (e.g., by automating large data comparisons or simulating behavior) 

**Tool support for management of testing and testware**
Examples of tools that support management of testing and testware include:

- Test management tools and application lifecycle management tools
- Requirements management tools
- Test harnesses

**Tool support for performance measurement and dynamic analysis**
Performance measurement and dynamic analysis tools are essential in supporting performance and load
testing activities, as these activities cannot effectively be done manually. Examples of these tools include: 

- Performance testing tools 
- Dynamic analysis tools

**Tool support for specialized testing needs**
In addition to tools that support the general test process, there are many other tools that support more
specific testing for non-functional characteristics. 


###  Benefits and Risks of Test Automation 

Potential benefits of using tools to support test execution include:

- Reduction in repetitive manual work , thus saving time
- Greater consistency and repeatability 
- More objective assessment t (e.g., static measures, coverage) 
- Easier access to information about testing (e.g., statistics and graphs about test progress, defect
rates and performance)

Potential risks of using tools to support testing include: 

- Expectations for the tool may be unrealistic (including functionality and ease of use) 
- The time, cost and effort for the initial introduction of a tool may be under-estimated (including
training and external expertise) 
- The time and effort needed to achieve significant and continuing benefits from the tool may be
under-estimated (including the need for changes in the test process and continuous improvement
in the way the tool is used) 
- The effort required to maintain the test work products generated by the tool may be underestimated 
- The tool may be relied on too much (seen as a replacement for test design or execution, or the
use of automated testing where manual testing would be better) 
- Version control of test work products may be neglected 
- Relationships and interoperability issues between critical tools may be neglected, such as
requirements management tools, configuration management tools, defect management tools and
tools from multiple vendors 
- The tool vendor may go out of business, retire the tool, or sell the tool to a different vendor 
- The vendor may provide a poor response for support, upgrades, and defect fixes 
- An open source project may be suspended 
- A new platform or technology may not be supported by the tool 
- There may be no clear ownership of the tool (e.g., for mentoring, updates, etc.) 


### Special Considerations for Test Execution and Test Management Tools

**Test execution tools**
Test execution tools execute test objects using automated test scripts. This type of tools often requires
significant effort in order to achieve significant benefits. 

- *Capturing test approach:* Capturing tests by recording the actions of a manual tester seems
attractive, but this approach does not scale to large numbers of test scripts. A captured script is a
linear representation with specific data and actions as part of each script. This type of script may
be unstable when unexpected events occur, and require ongoing maintenance as the systemâ€™s
user interface evolves over time.

- *Data-driven test approach:* This test approach separates out the test inputs and expected
results, usually into a spreadsheet, and uses a more generic test script that can read the input
data and execute the same test script with different data. 

- *Keyword-driven test approach:* This test approach, a generic script processes keywords
describing the actions to be taken (also called action words), which then calls keyword scripts to
process the associated test data. 

**Test management tools**

Test management tools often need to interface with other tools or spreadsheets for various reasons,
including: 

- To produce useful information in a format that fits the needs of the organization 
- To maintain consistent traceability to requirements in a requirements management tool 
- To link with test object version information in the configuration management tool

This is particularly important to consider when using an integrated tool (e.g., Application Lifecycle
Management), which includes a test management module, as well as other modules (e.g., project
schedule and budget information) that are used by different groups within an organization.
