#  Traceability between the Test Basis and Test Work Products

It is important to establish and maintain traceability throughout the test process between each element of
the test basis and the various test work products associated with that element. In addition to the evaluation
of test coverage, good traceability supports:

- Analyzing the impact of changes 
- Making testing auditable 
- Meeting IT governance criteria 
- Improving the understandability of test progress reports and test summary reports to include the
status of elements of the test basis (e.g., requirements that passed their tests, requirements that
failed their tests, and requirements that have pending tests) 
- Relating the technical aspects of testing to stakeholders in terms that they can understand 
- Providing information to assess product quality, process capability, and project progress against
business goals

**NOTE**

Some test management tools provide test work product models that match part or all of the test work
products. Some organizations build their own management systems to organize
the work products and provide the information traceability they require.
