# The Psychology of Testing 

Human psychology has important effects on software testing.

### Human Psychology and Testing 

- Identifying defects or failures may be perceived as criticism of the product and of its author. 
- An element of human psychology called confirmation bias can make it difficult to accept information that disagrees with currently held beliefs. 
- It is a common human trait to blame the bearer of badnews, and information produced by testing often contains bad news.
- Some people may perceive testing as a destructive activity, even though it contributes greatly to project progress and product quality 
- To reduce bad perceptions, information about defects and failures should be communicated in a constructive way. 
- Testers and test managers need to have good interpersonal skills to be able to communicate effectively
about defects, failures, test results, test progress, and risks, and to build positive relationships with
colleagues. 

Ways to communicate well include the following examples: 
- Start with collaboration rather than battles. 
- Remind everyone of the common goal of better quality systems. 
- Emphasize the benefits of testing (e.g save money or increasing skills). 
- Communicate test results and other findings in a neutral, fact-focused way without criticizing the
person who created the defective item. 
- Write objective and factual defect reports and review findings.
- Try to understand how the other person feels and the reasons they may react negatively to the
information.
- Confirm that the other person has understood what has been said and vice versa.

### Tester’s and Developer’s Mindsets 

Developers and testers often think differently. The primary objective of development is to design and build
a product, the objectives of testing include verifying and validating the product,
finding defects prior to release, and so forth. These are different sets of objectives which require different
mindsets. Bringing these mindsets together helps to achieve a higher level of product quality.

**Tester’s mindset:** It should include curiosity, professional pessimism, a critical eye, attention to
detail, and a motivation for good and positive communications and relationships. 

**Developer’s mindset**: Successful developers are often more interested in designing and building solutions 
than in contemplating what might be wrong with those solutions. In addition, confirmation bias makes it difficult to become aware of errors committed
by themselves. With the right mindset, developers are able to test their own code.

**NOTE**

Different software development lifecycle models often have different ways of organizing the testers and test activities. Having some of the
test activities done by independent testers increases defect detection effectiveness, which is particularly
important for large, complex, or safety-critical systems. Independent testers bring a perspective which is
different than that of the work product authors (i.e., business analysts, product owners, designers, and
developers), since they have different cognitive biases from the authors.
