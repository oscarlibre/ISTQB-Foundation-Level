# What is Testing?

Software testing is a way to assess the quality of the software and reduce the risk of sofware failure in operation.

**Other types of testing**

- Testing that involves the execution of the component or system being tested is called dynamic testing. 

- Testing that not involve the execution of the component or system being tested is called static testing. 

- Testing also includes reviewing work products such as requirements, user stories, and source code.

Software that does not work correctly can lead to many problems such as:

- Loss of money
- Loss of time
- Bad business reputation
- Injury or death

###  Common misperceptions

 - Testing only consists of running tests, i.e., executing the software and checking the results: Software testing is a process which includes many
different activities; test execution (including checking of results) is only one of these activities. The test
process also includes activities such as test planning, analyzing, designing, and implementing tests,
reporting test progress and results, and evaluating the quality of a test object.

- Testing focuses entirely on verification of requirements, user stories, or other specifications:  While testing does involve checking whether the system meets specified
requirements, it also involves validation, which is checking whether the system will meet user and other
stakeholder needs in its operational environment(s). 


### Typical Objectives of Testing

For any given project, the objectives of testing may include: 

- To prevent defects by evaluate work products such as requirements, user stories, design, and code 
- To verify whether all specified requirements have been fulfilled 
- To check whether the test object is complete and validate if it works as the users and other stakeholders expect
- To build confidence in the level of quality of the test object 
- To find defects and failures thus reduce the level of risk of inadequate software quality 
- To provide sufficient information to stakeholders to allow them to make informed decisions,
especially regarding the level of quality of the test object 
- To comply with contractual, legal, or regulatory requirements or standards, and/or to verify the
test object’s compliance with such requirements or standards


The objectives of testing can vary, depending upon the context of the component or system being tested,
the test level, and the software development lifecycle model. These differences may include, for example: 

- During component testing, one objective may be to find as many failures as possible so that the
underlying defects are identified and fixed early. Another objective may be to increase code
coverage of the component tests. 

- During acceptance testing, one objective may be to confirm that the system works as expected
and satisfies requirements. Another objective of this testing may be to give information to
stakeholders about the risk of releasing the system at a given time. 

### Testing and Debugging

Testing and debugging are different. Executing tests can show failures that are caused by defects in the
software. Debugging is the development activity that finds, analyzes, and fixes such defects. Subsequent
confirmation testing checks whether the fixes resolved the defects. In some cases, testers are
responsible for the initial test and the final confirmation test, while developers do the debugging,
associated component and component integration testing (continues integration). However, in Agile
development and in some other software development lifecycles, testers may be involved in debugging
and component testing.
