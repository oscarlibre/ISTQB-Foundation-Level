# Why is Testing Necessary?

- Rigorous testing of components and systems can help reduce the risk of failures occurring during operation
- When defects are detected and fixed, this contributes to the quality of the components or systems
- Testing may be required to meet contractual or legal requirements or industry-specific standards

### Testing’s Contributions to Success

Using appropriate test techniques can reduce the frequency of problematic deliveries, when those techniques 
are applied with the appropriate level of test expertise, in the appropriate test levels, and at the 
appropriate points in the software development lifecycle. Examples include: 

- Having testers involved in requirements reviews or user story refinement could detect defects in
these work products. The identification and removal of requirements defects reduces the risk of
incorrect or untestable features being developed. 

- Having testers work closely with system designers while the system is being designed can
increase each party’s understanding of the design and how to test it. This increased
understanding can reduce the risk of fundamental design defects and enable tests to be identified
at an early stage. 

- Having testers work closely with developers while the code is under development can increase
each party’s understanding of the code and how to test it. This increased understanding can
reduce the risk of defects within the code and the tests. 

- Having testers verify and validate the software prior to release can detect failures that might
otherwise have been missed, and support the process of removing the defects that caused the
failures (i.e., debugging). This increases the likelihood that the software meets stakeholder needs
and satisfies requirements. 

- The achievement of defined test objectives contributes to overall software development and maintenance success


### Quality Assurance and Testing 

*Quality management*: Includes all activities that direct and control an organization with regard to quality.
Among other activities, includes quality assurance and quality control.

*Quality assurance*: Focused on adherence to proper processes, in order to provide confidence that the
appropriate levels of quality will be achieved. In addition, the use of root cause analysis to detect and remove the causes of defects, along with the proper
application of the findings of retrospective meetings to improve processes, are important for effective quality assurance.

*Quality control*: Involves test activities, that support the achievement of appropriate levels of quality. 
Test activities are part of the overall software development or maintenance process. 

### Errors, Defects, and Failures

"A person can make an error (mistake), which produces a defect (fault, bug) in the code, in software or a system,
or a document. If the execution of the defect in code happens, the system will fail to do what it should do 
or something it shouldn’t), which causes a failure." - Thomas Muller

*Error*: It is an human mistake. It could happen during the different phases of software development. Common causes:
 
 -  Time pressure 
 -  Human fallibility 
 -  Inexperienced or insufficiently skilled project participants 
 -  Miscommunication between project participants
 -  Complexity of the code, design, architecture, the underlying problem to be solved, and/or the
technologies used 
 -  Misunderstandings about intra-system and inter-system interfaces, especially when such intrasystem and inter-system interactions are large in number 
 -  New, unfamiliar technologies
 
 *Defect*: It is a variance between expected and actual results (Also known as fault or bug).
 
 *Failure*: It is a consequence of a Defect in the code,  however failures can also be caused by environmental
conditions by changing hardware conditions.

**NOTE**

Not all unexpected test results are failures. False positives may occur due to errors in the way tests were
executed, or due to defects in the test data, the test environment, or other testware, or for other reasons.
The inverse situation can also occur, where similar errors or defects lead to false negatives.

### Defects, Root Causes and Effects

The root causes of defects are the earliest actions or conditions that contributed to creating the defects.
Defects can be analyzed to identify their root causes, so as to reduce the occurrence of similar defects in
the future. The effects are the problems caused by the failures (for example, Loss of money, bad business reputation
complaints...etc).
