# Test Organization

### Independent Testing 

A certain degree of independence often makes the tester more effective at finding defects
due to differences between the author’s and the tester’s cognitive biases. 

Degrees of independence in testing include the following (from low level of independence to high level): 

- No independent testers; the only form of testing available is developers testing their own code 
- Independent developers or testers within the development teams or the project team; this could
be developers testing their colleagues’ products 
- Independent test team or group within the organization, reporting to project management or
executive management 
- Independent testers from the business organization or user community, or with specializations in
specific test types such as usability, security, performance, regulatory/compliance, or portability 
- Independent testers external to the organization, either working on-site (in-house) or off-site
(outsourcing)

For most types of projects, it is usually best to have multiple test levels, with some of these levels handled
by independent testers. Developers should participate in testing, especially at the lower levels, so as to
exercise control over the quality of their own work.

The way in which independence of testing is implemented varies depending on the software development
lifecycle model. For example, in Agile development, testers may be part of a development team. In some
organizations using Agile methods, these testers may be considered part of a larger independent test
team as well. In addition, in such organizations, product owners may perform acceptance testing to
validate user stories at the end of each iteration.

Potential benefits of test independence include: 

- Independent testers are likely to recognize different kinds of failures compared to developers
because of their different backgrounds, technical perspectives, and biases 
- An independent tester can verify, challenge, or disprove assumptions made by stakeholders
during specification and implementation of the system 
- Independent testers of a vendor can report in an upright and objective manner about the system
under test without (political) pressure of the company that hired them

Potential drawbacks of test independence include: 

- Isolation from the development team, may lead to a lack of collaboration, delays in providing
feedback to the development team, or an adversarial relationship with the development team 
- Developers may lose a sense of responsibility for quality 
- Independent testers may be seen as a bottleneck 
- Independent testers may lack some important information

**NOTE:**
Many organizations are able to successfully achieve the benefits of test independence while avoiding the
drawbacks.

### Tasks of a Test Manager and Tester 

The test manager is tasked with overall responsibility for the test process and successful leadership
of the test activities. The test management role might be performed by a professional test manager, or by a
project manager, a development manager, or a quality assurance manager. In larger projects or
organizations, several test teams may report to a test manager, test coach, or test coordinator, each team
being headed by a test leader or lead tester.

Typical test manager tasks may include: 

- Develop or review a test policy and test strategy for the organization 
- Plan the test activities by considering the context, and understanding the test objectives and
risks. This may include selecting test approaches, estimating test time, effort and cost, acquiring
resources, defining test levels and test cycles, and planning defect management 
- Write and update the test plan(s) 
- Coordinate the test plan(s) with project managers, product owners, and others 
- Share testing perspectives with other project activities, such as integration planning 
- Initiate the analysis, design, implementation, and execution of tests, monitor test progress and
results, and check the status of exit criteria (or definition of done) and facilitate test completion
activities 
- Prepare and deliver test progress reports and test summary reports based on the information
gathered 
- Adapt planning based on test results and progress (sometimes documented in test progress
reports, and/or in test summary reports for other testing already completed on the project) and
take any actions necessary for test control 
- Support setting up the defect management system and adequate configuration management of
testware 
- Introduce suitable metrics for measuring test progress and evaluating the quality of the testing
and the product 
- Support the selection and implementation of tools to support the test process, including
recommending the budget for tool selection (and possibly purchase and/or support), allocating
time and effort for pilot projects, and providing continuing support in the use of the tool(s) 
- Decide about the implementation of test environment(s) 
- Promote and advocate the testers, the test team, and the test profession within the organization 
- Develop the skills and careers of testers (e.g., through training plans, performance evaluations,
coaching, etc.) 

Typical tester tasks may include: 

- Review and contribute to test plans 
- Analyze, review, and assess requirements, user stories and acceptance criteria, specifications,
and models for testability (i.e., the test basis) 
- Identify and document test conditions, and capture traceability between test cases, test
conditions, and the test basis 
- Design, set up, and verify test environment(s), often coordinating with system administration and
network management 
- Design and implement test cases and test procedures 
- Prepare and acquire test data 
- Create the detailed test execution schedule 
- Execute tests, evaluate the results, and document deviations from expected results 
-Use appropriate tools to facilitate the test process 
- Automate tests as needed (may be supported by a developer or a test automation expert) 
- Evaluate non-functional characteristics such as performance efficiency, reliability, usability,
security, compatibility, and portability 
- Review tests developed by others 

People who work on test analysis, test design, specific test types, or test automation may be specialists in
these roles. Depending on the risks related to the product and the project, and the software development
lifecycle model selected, different people may take over the role of tester at different test levels. For
example, at the component testing level and the component integration testing level, the role of a tester is
often done by developers. At the acceptance test level, the role of a tester is often done by business
analysts, subject matter experts, and users. At the system test level and the system integration test level,
the role of a tester is often done by an independent test team. At the operational acceptance test level,
the role of a tester is often done by operations and/or systems administration staff.
