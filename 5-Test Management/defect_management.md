# Defect Management 

- Defects found during testing should be logged
- Any defects identified should be investigated and should be tracked from discovery and classification to their resolution 
- An organization should establish a defect management process which includes a workflow and rules for
classification
- Testers should attempt to minimize the number of false positives reported as defects
- Defects may be reported during coding, static analysis, reviews, or during dynamic testing, or use of a
software product
- Defects may be reported for issues in code or working systems, or in any type of
documentation including requirements, user stories and acceptance criteria, development documents,
test documents, user manuals, or installation guides.

Typical defect reports have the following objectives:

- Provide developers and other parties with information about any adverse event that occurred, to
enable them to identify specific effects, to isolate the problem with a minimal reproducing test,
and to correct the potential defect(s), as needed or to otherwise resolve the problem
- Provide test managers a means of tracking the quality of the work product and the impact on the
testing (e.g., if a lot of defects are reported, the testers will have spent a lot of time reporting them
instead of running tests, and there will be more confirmation testing needed) 
- Provide ideas for development and test process improvement

A defect report filed during dynamic testing typically includes: 

- An identifier 
- A title and a short summary of the defect being reported 
- Date of the defect report, issuing organization, and author 
- Identification of the test item (configuration item being tested) and environment 
- The development lifecycle phase(s) in which the defect was observed 
- A description of the defect to enable reproduction and resolution, including logs, database dumps,
screenshots, or recordings (if found during test execution) 
- Expected and actual results 
- Scope or degree of impact (severity) of the defect on the interests of stakeholder(s) 
- Urgency/priority to fix 
- State of the defect report (e.g., open, deferred, duplicate, waiting to be fixed, awaiting
confirmation testing, re-opened, closed) 
- Conclusions, recommendations and approvals 
- Global issues, such as other areas that may be affected by a change resulting from the defect 
- Change history, such as the sequence of actions taken by project team members with respect to
the defect to isolate, repair, and confirm it as fixed 
- References, including the test case that revealed the problem

An example of the contents of a defect report can be found in ISO standard (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3)
(which refers to defect reports as incident reports).
