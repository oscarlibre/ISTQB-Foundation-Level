# Categories of Test Techniques 

A test technique helps in identifying test conditions, test cases, and test data. The choice of which test techniques to use depends on a number of factors, including:

- Component or system complexity 
- Regulatory standards 
- Customer or contractual requirements 
- Risk levels and types 
- Available documentation 
- Tester knowledge and skills 
- Available tools 
- Time and budget 
- Software development lifecycle model 
- The types of defects expected in the component or system

### Categories of Test Techniques and Their Characteristics 

Test techniques are classified as black-box, white-box, or experience-based. 

*Black-box test techniques* (also called behavioral or 
behavior-based techniques) are based on an analysis of the appropriate test basis (e.g., formal requirements documents, specifications,
use cases, user stories, or business processes). These techniques are applicable to both functional and nonfunctional testing.
Common characteristics of black-box test techniques include the following: 
  - Test conditions, test cases, and test data are derived from a test basis that may include software
    requirements, specifications, use cases, and user stories 
  - Test cases may be used to detect gaps between the requirements and the implementation of the
    requirements, as well as deviations from the requirements 
  - Coverage is measured based on the items tested in the test basis and the technique applied to
    the test basis 
    
*White-box test techniques* (also called structural or structure-based techniques) are based on an analysis
of the architecture, detailed design, internal structure, or the code of the test object.
Common characteristics of white-box test techniques include:
  - Test conditions, test cases, and test data are derived from a test basis that may include code,
software architecture, detailed design, or any other source of information regarding the structure
of the software 
  - Coverage is measured based on the items tested within a selected structure (e.g., the code or
interfaces) and the technique applied to the test basis 

*Experience-based test techniques* leverage the experience of developers, testers and users to design,
implement, and execute tests. These techniques are often combined with black-box and white-box test
techniques.Common characteristics of experience-based test techniques include:
  - Test conditions, test cases, and test data are derived from a test basis that may include
knowledge and experience of testers, developers, users and other stakeholders
